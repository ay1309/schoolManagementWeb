This project consists of a basic school management website. 
The system is able to register, show, and delete user data for teachers and students as well as differenciate between each one of them. A tecaher can create subjects and register students while the other part (students) can look at their subjects and grades. 
Tools used:
- JavaScript as main language
- MongoDB for the database
- Express tools such as Handlebars 
- HTML syntaxis for the interface
- Local server creation and update
